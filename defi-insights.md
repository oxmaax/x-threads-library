## why most people still earn 0% on-chain

most users either keep assets idle or trust centralized platforms. the gap isn't about apy, it's about:
- fear of losing access to funds
- confusing interfaces
- not knowing which products are real vs ponzi

the next wave of defi will win by:
- making yield feel boring and predictable
- hiding complexity behind simple actions
- giving users self-custody while still feeling "cex-level" safe
