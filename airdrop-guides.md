# airdrop guides

## basic airdrop checklist

1. pick protocols with real products, not just hype.
2. interact consistently, not once.
3. focus on:
   - bridging
   - swapping
   - providing liquidity (if safe)
   - governance / on-chain actions

## simple rule

"would i still use this if there was no airdrop?"  
if the answer is yes, it's probably worth the time.
