# zkEVM notes

## what is a zkEVM in simple words?

a zkEVM tries to run ethereum-compatible smart contracts, but proves the work with zero-knowledge proofs. instead of every node re-checking everything, they verify a proof that says "this work was done correctly."

## why it matters

- cheaper transactions (batching)
- faster finality
- better privacy options later
- still keeps the ethereum developer experience mostly intact
